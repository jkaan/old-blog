This post is the first public post on my own blog site.

I set up this site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I always wanted to blog about my experience and my life, when I found out about Jekyll I wanted to try it out.

I really liked it and it's a really efficient way of blogging, you can have a blog up in a blink of an eye.

More information about me can be found on the About Me page, however I will give a short introduction here as well.
